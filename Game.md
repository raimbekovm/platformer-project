# Platformer Game Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document details the implementation of a platformer game, refactored from procedural to object-oriented programming style. The game features multiple levels, player movement mechanics, enemy interactions, and a complete game loop system.

The project represents a significant transformation from a procedural codebase to a well-structured object-oriented design. The refactoring process focused on three main components:

1. **Level Management System**
   - Implemented a robust level loading mechanism using Run-Length Encoding (RLE)
   - Created a dynamic level parsing system that reads from `.rll` files
   - Developed an efficient collision detection system for game elements
   - Implemented level state management for tracking game progress

2. **Player Character System**
   - Designed a physics-based movement system with smooth controls
   - Implemented a comprehensive collision response system
   - Created a state management system for player actions and status
   - Developed an interaction system for game elements (coins, spikes, enemies)

3. **Enemy System**
   - Implemented intelligent enemy movement patterns
   - Created a collision detection system for enemy-player interactions
   - Developed a state management system for enemy behavior
   - Implemented multiple enemy handling with proper memory management

The game features a complete state machine that manages different game states (Menu, Game, Paused, Death, Game Over, Victory), each with its own update and draw logic. The implementation follows object-oriented principles, emphasizing:

- **Encapsulation**: Each class manages its own state and behavior
- **Abstraction**: Clear interfaces for class interactions
- **Modularity**: Separated concerns between different game components
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception handling for file operations and game logic

The project demonstrates practical application of C++ features including:
- Smart memory management
- Exception handling
- File I/O operations
- Object-oriented design patterns
- Game state management
- Physics-based movement
- Collision detection algorithms

3. Created level loading/unloading logic
4. Split player logic into header and source files

### Step 2: Enemy System
1. Separated enemy.h into header and implementation files
2. Implemented basic enemy movement
3. Added enemy state management

### Step 3: Level System
1. Implemented level loading from files
2. Added collision detection system
3. Created game progress tracking
4. Implemented RLE parsing for level files

### Step 4: Player Enhancement
1. Refactored player functionality into class structure
2. Implemented movement mechanics
3. Added collision handling
4. Enhanced game mechanics

### Step 5: Final Integration
1. Refactored Enemy and Player classes
2. Implemented encapsulation of state
3. Enhanced movement logic
4. Improved collision handling

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Run-Length Encoding Implementation
**Problem**: Complex parsing of RLE format for level loading
**Solution**: Developed a two-pass parsing system with error handling and validation

### Challenge 2: State Management
**Problem**: Managing multiple game states and transitions while maintaining game consistency
**Solution**: Created a centralized state machine with clear state transitions and validation

### Challenge 3: Entity Interaction
**Problem**: Complex interactions between player, enemies, and game elements    
**Solution**: Developed a modular interaction system with clear separation of concerns
